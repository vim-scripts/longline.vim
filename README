longline#Show() highlights lines that are too long.
longline#Hide() unhighlights them.
longline#Toggle() does what you might expect.
longline#Exists() tells you whether there is a line in the file that is too long and is useful for statusline warnings.

the :LongLines command calls longline#Toggle()

You may configure how long is too long either globally or by file type.
